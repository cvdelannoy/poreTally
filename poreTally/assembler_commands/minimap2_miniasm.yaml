# When compiling your own yaml, note the following:
# - When referring to parameters in parameter files, use curly brackets, e.g. {WD}
# - Where you would normally use curly brackets, use double curly brackets, e.g. awk {print} becomes awk {{print}}
# - Escape single quotation marks (double quotation marks are fine), e.g. echo 'foo' --> echo \'foo\'

description: >
  Minimap2 is a fast all-vs-all mapper of reads that relies on sketches of sequences, composed of
  minimizers. Miniasm uses the found overlaps to construct an assembly graph.
  As a consensus step is lacking in this pipeline, post-assembly polishing is often required.
commands: |
  minimap2 -x ava-ont -t {NB_THREADS} {{input.fastq}} {{input.fastq}} | gzip -1 > minimap2.paf.gz
  miniasm -f {{input.fastq}} minimap2.paf.gz > minimap2_miniasm.gfa
  awk '/^S/{{{{print ">"$2"\\n"$3}}}}' minimap2_miniasm.gfa | fold > {{output}}
